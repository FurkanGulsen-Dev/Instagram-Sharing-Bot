## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (System Overview)

1. **Media Source (Folder Structure) ‚Äî Manual Placement Required**
   Users **manually place** media files into these folders:
   - `Gonderi` ‚Üí Standard Instagram posts (images/videos)
   - `Hikaye` ‚Üí Instagram stories
   - `Reels` ‚Üí Instagram reels (vertical videos)

   The bot **does not download or fetch media automatically**. It only posts the files you have manually added to these folders.

2. **Login & Authentication**
   - Credentials are read from `accounts.txt` in the format:
     ```
     username:password
     ```
   - Proxies (if used) are loaded from `proxy.txt` in the format:
     ```
     http://username:password@server:port
     ```
   - Secure session-based login is established and reused.

3. **Scheduling Module**
   - You can set a date/time for each post.
   - All schedules are stored in the SQL database for accuracy.

4. **Automation Engine**
   - At the scheduled time, the bot uploads the selected content.
   - Content type (Post, Story, Reels) is determined by the folder you placed it in.
   - Proper formatting is applied (e.g., vertical for Reels).

5. **Multi-Account Handling**
   - Supports multiple accounts via `accounts.txt`.
   - Each account can run with or without a proxy from `proxy.txt`.

6. **Reports & Logs**
   - All activity is written to `log.txt`.
   - Includes successful uploads, failed attempts, and proxy usage.
