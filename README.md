## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (System Overview)

1. **Media Source (Folder Structure)**  
   Users place media files into specific folders:  
   - `Gonderi` ‚Üí Standard Instagram posts  
   - `Hikaye` ‚Üí Instagram stories  
   - `Reels` ‚Üí Instagram reels  

   The bot scans these folders and prepares content automatically.  

2. **Login & Authentication**  
   - Credentials are read from `accounts.txt` in the format:  
     ```
     username:password
     ```  
   - Proxies (if used) are loaded from `proxy.txt` in the format:  
     ```
     http://username:password@server:port
     ```  
   - Secure session-based login is established and reused.  

3. **Scheduling Module**  
   - Users can assign date/time for each post.  
   - All schedules are stored in the SQL database for accuracy.  

4. **Automation Engine**  
   - At the scheduled time, the bot uploads content automatically.  
   - Content type (Post, Story, Reels) is detected by folder.  
   - Correct formatting is applied (e.g., vertical for Reels).  

5. **Multi-Account Handling**  
   - Supports unlimited accounts via `accounts.txt`.  
   - Each account can run with or without a proxy from `proxy.txt`.  

6. **Reports & Logs**  
   - All activity is written to `log.txt`.  
   - Includes successful uploads, failed attempts, and proxy usage.
