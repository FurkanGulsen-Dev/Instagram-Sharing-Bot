## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (System Overview)

1. **Media Source**  
   - Users place their images or videos inside the `Media` folder.  
   - The system automatically scans this folder to prepare content for upload.  

2. **Login & Authentication**  
   - Secure login is handled through session-based authentication.  
   - Once logged in, sessions are reused to avoid repetitive logins.  

3. **Scheduling Module**  
   - Users can select a date and time for each post.  
   - Schedules are stored in the SQL database for accuracy and reliability.  

4. **Automation Engine**  
   - At the scheduled time, the bot triggers the upload process.  
   - Reels and posts are formatted correctly (e.g., vertical for Reels, square for posts).  
   - The content is then uploaded to Instagram automatically.  

5. **Multi-Account Support**  
   - Multiple accounts can be linked.  
   - Each post can be assigned to a specific account.  

6. **Reports & Logs**  
   - Every posting attempt is logged.  
   - Success and failure reports are available for debugging and monitoring.
